# Anagix Loader

Our PDK packages (NDA free one is OpenRule1um) requires MinedaCommon.rb and MinedaPCell.rb defined in this repository. Because macro files under KLayout (.lym files) are loaded in an alphabetical order (seems like so), this package (AnagixLoader) is expected to be loaded first. loader.lym requires MinedaCommon and MinedaPCell. MinedaPCell.rb is a common open source part of PCell used in various PCells code. 
Our PDKs utilize Open PDK technology presented at SASIMI 2022 under the title "An NDA-free Oriented Open PDK
Technology and EDA for Small Volume LSI Developments".
